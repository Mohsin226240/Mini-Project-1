This project is a small, responsive company website showcasing a clean, accessible layout across three connected pages: Home, Services, and Contact. Itâ€™s built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and JavaScript to demonstrate core frontend skills without frameworks.
Home: hero with CTA, about section, features preview, and client testimonials
Services: at least four services with icons, hoverable cards, and a CTA to Contact
Contact: validated form (name, email, subject, message), company info, and an embedded Google Map
Interactivity: sticky navigation linking all pages, smooth scrolling on internal links, refined hover effects for buttons/cards/icons, and a modal confirmation on form submission
Enhancements: responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile, dark/light mode with persistence, and subtle on-scroll reveal animations
Ideal as a starter template or learning reference for building simple multipage sites with consistent theming, good spacing, and lightweight interactivity.
